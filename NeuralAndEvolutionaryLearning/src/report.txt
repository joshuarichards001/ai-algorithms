For all parts the given data was in the correct format

PART 1
Question 1:
-----------
8/8 after running 200 epochs
100% accuracy

Question 2:
-----------
Based on the given dataset I am getting perfect accuracy so there is no
room for improvement.





PART 2:
Question 1:
-----------
Input Nodes - 13
Output Nodes - 3
Hidden Nodes - 100

Each input node represents a different feature of the wine and these 13
values are what we compute to get the class. The output nodes represent
the 3 different classes that a wine can fall under. Finally the number
of hidden nodes is a value that I came to the conclusion on after extensive
testing to find the most effective value.

Question 2:
-----------
Learning Rate - 0.001
Momentum - 0.9
Initial Weight Ranges - Implemented by scikit-learn (fan_in and fan_out are
                        certain values within a layer)

                        init_bound = np.sqrt(6. / (fan_in + fan_out))
                        self._random_state.uniform(-init_bound, init_bound,
                                           (fan_in, fan_out))

After testing multiple options, these values proved to output the most accurate
results.

Question 3:
-----------
Training Termination Criteria - when the loss of score is not improving by at least
                                1e-4 for 10 consecutive iterations or if 1000 iterations
                                are run.

After testing multiple options these criteria proved to output the most accurate
results without over training.

Question 4:
-----------
(0.99 + 0.97 + 0.98 + 0.98 + 0.97 + 0.96 + 0.97 + 0.97 + 0.98 + 0.96) / 10

= 0.973 = 97.3% Accuracy Rate

After analysis of multiple variations in parameters I believe that this is
the highest mean value available with the given data sets and methods. With
with only (on average) 2-3 wines being misclassified I believe the results
are acceptable.

Question 5:
-----------
With my k nearest neighbor implementation (with a k value of 3) I was able
to achieve an accuracy of 95.5%. Although the distinction between these two
methods from a performance standpoint isn't enormous, the roughly 2% increase
using a perceptron method does give a noticeable improvement.





PART 3:
The reason I used gplearn as my library of choice for genetic programming
is because of it's user friendly experience and simplistic design. It
also follows the scikit-learn API which is a library I already have familiarity
with, making gplearn easier to pick up.

Question 1:
-----------
x, any number of random numbers

Question 2:
-----------
add, subtract, multiply, divide

Question 3:
-----------
The fitness function that was determined within gplearn provided excellent results
by default so adjustment of this function was not necessary. The process they use to
calculate there fitness function is with "mean absolute error" using this code:

    np.average(np.abs(y_pred - y), weights=w)

where it takes the average out of: the absolute value of the predicted y value subtracted
from the y value, and the calculated weights.

Question 4:
-----------
Stopping Criteria - 0.008
Generations - 20
Population - 5000

I used these values as they produced the most accurate results. With regard to the
stopping criteria this value was rarely reached as for the most part the most ideal
value was found at the conclusion of the generations rather than being caught by this
stopping criteria.

Question 5:
-----------
(Using mean absolute error rather than mean squared error as it was more effective
for my implementation)

Question 2:
-----------
add, subtract, multiply, divide

Question 3:
-----------
The fitness function that was determined within gplearn provided excellent results
by default so adjustment of the function was not necessary. The process they use to
calculate there fitness function is with "mean absolute error" using this code:

    np.average(np.abs(y_pred - y), weights=w)

where it takes the average out of: the absolute value of the predicted y value and
the y value, and the calculated weights.

Question 4:
-----------
Population Size - 500
Generations - 10
Stopping Criteria - 0.01

Question 5:
-----------
When creating my test and training data sets I randomly shuffled the original data set
and then evenly split it in half, with one half going into training.txt and the other
going into test.txt

Question 6:
-----------
(0.9 + 0.8774122807017544 + 0.9114035087719298 + 0.9524122807017544 + 0.9524122807017544 +
0.9065789473684212 + 0.9070175438596492 + 0.9065789473684212 + 0.9065789473684212 +
0.8774122807017544) / 10

 = 0.9098 = 90.98% Accuracy Rate
